The time complexity of this code is primarily determined by the dfs function. Let's break it down step-by-step:
Step-by-Step Analysis
​
Initial Setup and Sorting:
The function starts by iterating through the grid to separate all values and their coordinates. This step takes O(n×m)O(n×m) time, where nn is the number of rows and mm is the number of columns.
The values list is then sorted in descending order, which takes O((n×m)log⁡(n×m))O((n×m)log(n×m)) time.
​
DFS with Memoization:
The dfs function is the core part of the solution. Let's analyze its time complexity.
The dfs function is called recursively for every state defined by (i, mask_row).
i can take values from 0 to n×mn×m (the number of elements in the grid).
mask_row represents a bitmask indicating which rows have been used. Since there are nn rows, mask_row can take up to 2n2n different values.
Therefore, there can be up to (n×m)×2n(n×m)×2n unique states in the dfs function.
​
Memoization:
Memoization ensures that each unique state is computed only once. Thus, the time complexity of the dfs function with memoization is O((n×m)×2n)O((n×m)×2n).
